# BotAgente

## Project Setup with `pyproject.toml`

This project uses **Poetry** for dependency management instead of `requirements.txt`. Follow the steps below to set up and use the project.

---

## Installation

### 1. Install Poetry
First, make sure Poetry is installed. If you donâ€™t have it, install it using:

```sh
pip install poetry
```

Or install it using the official method:
```sh
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

### 2. Clone the Repository using SSH
```sh
git clone git@github.com:johnometalman/botAgente.git
cd botAgente
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```sh
poetry install
```
This will create a virtual environment and install all required dependencies.

### 4. Activate Virtual Environment (Optional)
Poetry manages its own virtual environments, but you can activate it manually if needed:

```sh
poetry shell
```

### 5. Run the Project
Once inside the virtual environment, you can run your Python scripts as usual:
```sh
python app.py
```

## Managing Dependencies

### Add a New Dependency
To install a new package and update `pyproject.toml` automatically:
```sh
poetry add package_name
```

### Remove a Dependency
```sh
poetry remove package_name
```

### Update Dependencies
To update all dependencies:
```sh
poetry update
```

To update a specific package:
```sh
poetry update package_name
```

---

## Environment Variables
This project relies on environment variables stored in a `.env` file. Create a `.env` file in the project root and add the following:

```ini
NOTION_TOKEN=your_notion_token
DATABASE_ID=your_database_id
WHATSAPP_GROUP_ID=your_whatsapp_group_id
```

---

## How the Project Works
- The script fetches data from a Notion database using the Notion API.
- It formats the retrieved data into a structured message.
- The message is sent to a WhatsApp group using `pywhatkit`.
- Once sent, the script updates the Notion database to mark the message as "Sent".

---

## Deploying or Sharing the Project
To ensure others can install the project easily, share your repository and let them run:
```sh
poetry install
```
This will install all dependencies listed in `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock`.
